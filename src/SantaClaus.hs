{-  SantaClaus.hs

    An implementation of the Santa Claus concurrency problem in Haskell using software
    transactional memory. The challenge is to coordinate the actions of multiple
    threads so they start at the same time. The cycle of actions that the reindeer and
    elves go through are essentially the same, so we have one generic function goActor
    that operates both types.

    The main pitfall to be aware of with this problem is queue-jumping, in particular
    other elves jumping in front of the 3 at the front of the queue once Santa has started
    collecting them. But we don't have to worry about this because the crew is always
    atomically pulled from the front of the queue all at once, and then referenced locally
    by the Santa thread. So any actors lining up behind the ones just selected have no
    choice but to wait until Santa is ready to check the queues again.
